                <p>
                    This project was written to be an application to help produce door schedule
                    reports. It was built using the Java Swing framework to create the GUI.
                    Previously, these reports were produced as a very long spreadsheet which were
                    hard to write and even harder to read. The aim with this project was to make
                    this process much easier.
                </p>
