                <h1>A-Level-Computer-Science-Coursework</h1>
                <h2>This was my coursework project for my A-Level Computer Science</h2>

                <p>
                    I used to play a lot of videogames in my spare time, so wanted to aim to make
                    something similar for my end project. I specifically remember having issues
                    trying to ensure my player could only jump on the same wall once (else they could
                    climb it infinitely). In the end, I opted to use SUVAT equations to calculate
                    the horizonatal acceleration such that when they jumped off the wall, if they
                    were to return back to that same wall, they would gain no vertical displacement.
                    One thing to note, this cannot be run through local files due to modern browsers'
                    Cross Origin Resource Sharing Policy so would need to be hosted on a webserver.
