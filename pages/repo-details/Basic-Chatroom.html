                <h2>Written to learn how to use websockets</h2>

                <p>
                    I wrote this bit of code not only to teach me about websockets, but also a bit more about
                    networking in general. It helped put into practise the info I had learned at uni about 
                    default gateways and IP addresses. The general gyst is you can start the server and then
                    connect multiple clients from completely different networks (if you want to set up port forwarding
                    as described in the README) so they can talk in real time. They can even assign themselves
                    to different rooms to talk in what are essentially open group chats. Clients can also assign 
                    themselves different names to be seen next to their message when received by others. Every message sent is forwarded through the server, so 
                    a user can be moderated if need. There's a whole plethora of other commands available to the
                    server, all of which can be found in the README. I am quite proud of this project,
                    because it acts as a good stepping point in learning how to set up a server for any API
                    projects I want to write.
