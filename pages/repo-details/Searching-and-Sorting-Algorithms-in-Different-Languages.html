                <h1>Searching-and-Sorting-Algorithms-in-Different-Languages</h1>
                <h2>Written to test my knowledge on the different basic searching and sorting 
                    algorithms, as well as to refresh on and learn new languages</h2>

                <p>
                    I started this just to refresh my memory on the different key algorithms. But as
                    I got more into it, I clocked that I could use this to teach myself how to write in different
                    langauges as well. I plan to keep updating this as I learn. In the README of the repo
                    as well as below you can see which languages have been added.
